============
Repositories
============

The project is organized in three Proofscape repositories, which are
open-source, and invite contributions.

The Literature Library
======================

Hosted at `gh.toepproj.lit`_, this is a collection of Proofscape modules
representing proofs from historical mathematical literature.

The library should encompass works by mathematicians like those apt to be
listed under the MacTutor_ biographies. It should cover classic works of
historical significance.

In terms of Proofscape concepts, the modules in this library contain only
deductions (no annotations). These deductions represent only theorems and
proofs from the literature (no expansions).

However, it is appropriate to record comparisons_, linking the nodes in this
library. These are akin to the editorial footnotes or cross-references often
found in collected works.


The Expansions and Examples Library
===================================

Hosted at `gh.toepproj.ex`_, this is a place to
provide enrichments.
Specifically, this library is for expansions
and example explorers.

An expansion is a Proofscape deduction that fills in
missing steps, to help readers span the inferential leaps taken in published
proofs.

Example explorers are Proofscape annotations that present interactive
displays where users can generate numerical examples of the types of objects in
play at given steps in proofs.


The English Translations Library
================================

Hosted at `gh.toepproj.en`_, this is a place for English translations of
mathematical papers written in other languages.

Generally speaking, translations of theorems and proofs do not belong here, and
should instead be added to the ``gh.toepproj.lit`` repo. This is instead a
place for translations of the "prose sections" of mathematical papers.
